# Connect Forth

A game of Connect Four written in Forth.

## Requirements

To build connect-forth, you need `make` and [Preforth](https://github.com/Arkaeriit/preforth).

To run it, you need a Forth environment. The supported one is [ASCminiForth](https://github.com/Arkaeriit/ASCminiForth), but work is being done to support [Gforth](https://gforth.org/).

## How to play
